This book establishes a new route through linear algebra, one that develops early the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), the so-called "jewel in crown" of linear algebra. Thereafter the beautiful power of the SVD both explores many modern applications, especially in Data Science, and also develops traditional linear algebra concepts, theory, and methods. No rigour is lost in this new route: indeed, this book demonstrates that most theory is better proved with an SVD rather than with a traditional approach. This new route through linear algebra becomes available by the ready availability of ubiquitous computing in the 21st century.
