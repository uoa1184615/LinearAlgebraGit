Linear Algebra for 21st C Application
=====================================

This textbook provides a new exciting introduction and
development of the power of linear algebra in modern
science, engineering and computing.  I make draft versions
and source available here for others to collaborate in this
venture.

In this directory: 
* larxxia-newest.pdf is the current draft version (download with "Save Link As...")
* slides-newest.pdf is a version for projection in class to talk around
* Videos is a folder of short videos of examples, proofs, etc
* LinearAlgebra is the folder of the source of the text


I seek others to aid development by any of
* trialling this textbook in classes
* providing feedback and corrections
* contributing examples, exercises, and suggestions
* collaborating on developing sections or chapters
