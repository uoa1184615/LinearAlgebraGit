\begin{comment}
Suggest not to include in a first version.

Possible plan to cover aspects from numerical linear algebra \cite[e.g.]{Trefethen1997}:
\begin{itemize}
\item possibly projections, incl with orthonormal basis (although have done so already)
\item QR factorisation \cite[\S8.3]{Nakos1998}, Gram--Schmidt, orthog poly, stabilised, ensemble forecasting (again?)
\item possibly Householder orthog diagonalisation
\item least squares approx using QR  \cite[\S8.4]{Nakos1998}
\item smallest possible solution using QR of transpose
\item QR iteration for eigen-problem \cite[\S8.3]{Nakos1998}, find an \svd
\end{itemize}
