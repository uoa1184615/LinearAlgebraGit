\chapter{Complex inner product vector spaces}
\label{ch:cipvs}

\minitoc

The previous chapters explored many beautiful patterns in the linear algebra of real vectors and matrices.
These same patterns are seen time and time again: in the differential equations of engineering and science; in the complex matrices of quantum physics; and in the dynamics of time delay systems in biology.
But to use our powerful results in these areas we need to extend  linear algebra to both complex vectors\slash matrices and to `infinite' dimensions.

\begin{comment}
Suggest not to include in a first version.

Plan to cover at a more abstract level \pooliv{Ch.6 and~7} \larsvii{Ch.5 and~8} \holti{Ch.10, \S11.4--5}:
\begin{itemize}
\item def (complex) vector space, incl functions
\item inner products and norms, incl integrals, basic orthog polys
\item generalized symmetric eigen-problem \(A\xv=\lambda B\xv\) and orthog with weighted inner product
\item linear transforms, range, kernel, with calculus applications
\item unitary matrices (poss quantum physics appl)
\item \svd: solutions and approximations
\item eigen-problem, linear independence, generalized eigenvectors, basis, change of basis, relate to FT, Hermitian matrices
\end{itemize}

Alternatively, could distribute this material as `advanced' sections at the end of various chapters.
\begin{itemize}
\item \cref{ch:v} def (complex) vector space, incl functions
\item \cref{ch:v} inner products and norms, incl integrals, basic orthog polys
\item \cref{ch:eesm} generalized symmetric eigen-problem \(A\xv=\lambda B\xv\) and orthog with weighted inner product, relate to FT, Hermitian matrices
\item \cref{ch:m}linear transforms, range, kernel, with calculus applications
\item \cref{ch:m} unitary matrices (poss quantum physics appl)
\item \cref{ch:m} \svd: solutions and approximations
\item \cref{ch:gee} eigen-problem, linear independence, generalized eigenvectors, basis, change of basis
\end{itemize}
