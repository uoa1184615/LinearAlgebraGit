\chapter{Approximate matrices}
\label{ch:am}
\minitoc


\begin{aside}
This chapter could be studied any time after Chapter~\ref{ch:m} to help the transition to more abstract linear algebra.  
Useful as spaced revision of the \svd, rank, orthogonality, and so~on.
\end{aside}

This chapter develops how concepts associated with \idx{length} and \idx{distance} applies to matrices as well as vectors.  
Further courses on Linear Algebra place these in a unifying framework that also encompasses much you see both in solving differential equations (and integral equations) and in problems involving complex numbers (such as those in electrical engineering or quantum physics). 



\begin{comment} 
Huge applications of \svd{}s to video compression, experimental errors, and other areas.
Introduce digital \idx{image compression} by \svd{}s \pooliv{p.607--8} \holti{p.336--7}  \cite[\S07]{Davis99a}.
\cite{Higham86} mentions applications of \idx{polar decomposition} to the Orthogonal Procrustes problem.
