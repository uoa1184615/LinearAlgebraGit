\chapter{Approximate matrices}
\label{ch:am}

\minitoc



This chapter 
develops how concepts associated with \idx{length} and \idx{distance} not only apply to vectors but also apply to matrices.  
More advanced courses on linear algebra place these in a unifying framework that also encompasses much you see both in solving differential equations (and integral equations) and in problems involving complex numbers (such as those in electrical engineering or \text{quantum physics).}

This chapter could be studied any time after \cref{ch:m} to help the transition to more abstract linear algebra.  
It also is good revision of the \svd, rank, orthogonality, and so~on.



\begin{comment} 
Huge applications of \svd{}s to video compression, experimental errors, and other areas.
Introduce digital \idx{image compression} by \svd{}s \pooliv{p.607--8} \holti{p.336--7}  \cite[\S07]{Davis99a}.
\cite{Higham86} mentions applications of \idx{polar decomposition} to the Orthogonal Procrustes problem.
